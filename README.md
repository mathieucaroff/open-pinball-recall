# Open Pinball Recall

![Game preview](asset/img/game-screenshot.png)

This is a game to train working memory. It is a ripoff from Lumosity's Pinball Recall. It consists in memorizing the position and direction of bumpers in a grid and guessing the place where a ball will exit the grid given the place where it enters.
